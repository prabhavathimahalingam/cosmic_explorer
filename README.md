# 🌌 Cosmic Explorer

**Cosmic Explorer** is a fully interactive, real-time simulation of our solar system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visually explore all 8 planets, view their orbits, and learn scientific facts by interacting with each celestial body. Designed as an educational tool, it combines accurate planetary data with immersive animations and a responsive UI.

## 🚀 Features

- 🪐 **Real-Time Planetary Motion**  
  All 8 planets orbit the Sun in real-time using animated CSS and JavaScript logic.

- 🖱️ **Planet Interactivity**  
  Click on any planet to:
  - Enlarge and highlight it
  - Display the planet name and number of moons
  - Redirect to a dedicated information page

- 🌍 **Individual Planet Pages**  
  Each planet has its own HTML page with:
  - High-resolution images
  - Detailed scientific data (distance, temperature, moons, etc.)
  - Trivia and key facts

- 🌌 **Immersive Space Background**  
  The project includes stars, comets, and satellites to mimic a realistic cosmic environment.

- 🎨 **Animated Orbits and Design**  
  Smooth orbital motion with glowing visual effects for planets and the Sun.
